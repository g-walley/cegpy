    "This example builds a **C**hain **E**vent **G**raph (**CEG**) from a asymmetric dataset. In simple words, a dataset is asymmetric when the event tree describing the dataset is not symmetric around its root. The class of CEGs built from asymmetric event trees is said to be non-stratified. Note that, technically, a CEG is also said to be non-stratified when the order of events along its different paths is not the same, even though its event tree might be symmetric. Whilst such processes can also be easily modelled with the cegpy package, for this example we focus on non-stratified CEGs that are built from asymmetric event trees/datasets.\n",

    "Asymmetry in a dataset arises when it has structural zeros or structural missing values in certain rows; in other words, the sample space of a variable is different or empty respectively, depending on its ancestral variables. So logically, certain values of the variable will never be observed for certain configurations of its ancestral variables, irrespective of the sample size.\n",

In this case, we would observe individuals in our dataset who are not assessed, going down the ‘Not Referred & Not Treated’ path with probability 1. This is not helpful, and so we choose to condense the tree and remove this edge. The zero observations for non-assessed individuals for the categories of ‘Referred & Treated’ and ‘Not Referred & Treated’ are both structural zeros."
