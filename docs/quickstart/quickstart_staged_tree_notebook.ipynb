    "`cegpy` allows the user to specify which situations are allowed to be merged by the AHC algorithm. This is done by specifying a *hyperstage* [(Collazo et al., 2017)](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/91075/1/WRAP_Theses_Collazo_2017.pdf) which is a collection of sets such that two situations cannot be in the same stage unless they belong to the same set in the hyperstage. Under a default setting in `cegpy`, all situations which have the same number of outgoing edges and equivalent set of edge labels are in the same set within the hyperstage. The default hyperstages of a given tree can be displayed by accessing the `hyperstage` property, which returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains situations belonging to the same hyperstage."
