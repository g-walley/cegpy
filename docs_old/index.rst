Welcome to Cegpy's documentation!
=================================
**Cegpy** (/segpaÉª/) is a Python package for working with Chain Event Graphs. It supports learning the graphical structure of a Chain Event Graph from data, encoding of parametric and structural priors, estimating its parameters, and performing inference.

It is built on top of the Python network modelling package NetworkX.
